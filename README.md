## Features

### Adopt a dog: 
On the landing page, users can select their location, and all the dogs available for adoption in that location will be rendered on the search page. The search page has a filter bar, where users can filter the dogs based on breed, age, and gender. Clicking on a dog's card will take the user to the dog's details page, where they can view the dog's details, including the owner's information. Users can contact the owner by sending a message. EmailJS has been integrated to send emails to both the user and the dog owner with a chat application link, where they can chat with each other for further procedures.

### Donate a dog: 
Users can also donate dogs by clicking the donate button on the landing page. This will take the user to the donate page, where they can fill out a form with all the required details of the dog.
